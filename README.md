# Hackathon-2025
ULM hawkathon 2025- April
This project is a personalized tech exploration assistant website that helps users find the best path to start or grow in tech. By answering a short form about their background, skill level, goals, and preferences, users receive a custom learning roadmap generated by AI (DeepSeek). Each step includes free, high-quality resources scraped from the web to guide their learning. Users can log in, track their progress, and stay motivated with a clear, structured plan tailored just for them. The platform is designed to make tech education more accessible, focused, and efficient for beginners and career changers.
